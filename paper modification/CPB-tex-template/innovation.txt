this paper analysis the interaction process between test particle electron
and electromagnetic(EM) wave 
Core Innovations:
1.Angular Momentum Conservation Framework.To the best of 
our knowelege, the is the first paper explicit incorporation
of angular momentum conservation in the quantum analysis
of anomalous doppler resonance.
2.Polarization-Dependent Resonance. Based on angular momentum
conservation, this paper demonstrated why the left hand polarization waves
drive anomalous doppler resonance for electron in magnetic field while
right hand polarization waves drive  normal doppler resonance.
3.Energy transfer ratio. The parallel kinetic energy and gyro-kinetic
energy change ratio of electron during resonant with EM wave is derivated and 
verified from numerical simulation, which maybe cricuial to plasma heating and 
current drive.



This paper analyzes the interaction process between test particle electron and electromagnetic (EM) waves.

Core Innovations:

1.Angular Momentum Conservation Framework: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper to explicitly incorporate angular momentum conservation into the quantum analysis of anomalous Doppler resonance.

2.Polarization-Dependent Resonance: Based on angular momentum conservation, this paper demonstrates why left-hand polarized waves drive anomalous Doppler resonance for electrons in a magnetic field, while right-hand polarized waves drive normal Doppler resonance.

3.Energy Transfer Ratio: The ratio of parallel kinetic energy to gyro-kinetic energy change for electrons during resonance with EM waves is derived and verified through numerical simulation. This ratio may be crucial for understanding plasma heating and current drive.
