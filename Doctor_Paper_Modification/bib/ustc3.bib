   abstract = {This Letter presents a rigorous kinetic theory for relativistic runaway electrons in the near critical electric field in tokamaks. The theory provides a distribution function of the runaway electrons, reveals the presence of two different threshold electric fields, and describes a mechanism for hysteresis in the runaway electron avalanche. Two different threshold electric fields characterize a minimal field required for sustainment of the existing runaway population and a higher field required for the avalanche onset. The near-threshold regime for runaway electrons determines the time scale of toroidal current decay during runaway mitigation in tokamaks.},

   abstract = {Relativistic electrons emit synchrotron radiation due to their gyro- and guiding-center motions in a curved magnetic field. In this article, the kinetic theory of relativistic electron beams is developed to account for radiation reaction by including the Abraham-Lorentz reaction force in the kinetic equation. As an application of this theory, the dynamics of runaway electrons is examined and a steady-state solution is constructed describing a balance between acceleration by the electric field, pitch-angle scattering, and radiation reaction. Furthermore, it is found that a beam of relativistic electrons can be slowed down by the combined effects of pitch-angle scattering and radiation reaction. This damping can be more efficient than ordinary collisional drag, and appears to explain the decay of post-disruption runaway currents in the Joint European Torus (JET) [R. D. Gill, Nucl. Fusion 33, 1613 (1993)]. (C) 2001 American Institute of Physics.},

Applications such as the luminosity of a collider, the use as kinematic variable, and the statistical theory of collisions in a relativistic classical gas are reviewed. It is emphasized how the hyperbolic properties of the velocity space explain the peculiarities of relativistic scattering.},

We present a form of the generalized collision operator which is suitable for implementation in a numerical kinetic equation solver, and demonstrate the effect on the runaway-electron growth rate. Finally we consider the reverse avalanche effect, where runaways are slowed down by large-angle collisions, and show that the choice of operator is important if the electric field is close to the avalanche threshold.},

A novel diagnostic of the nonthermal electron cyclotron emission from runaway electrons can be utilized for this purpose. It was designed and installed at the COMPASS tokamak based on the available heterodyne radiometer. The vertical ECE (V-ECE) system uses a 16-channel heterodyne radiometer with a vertically placed E2-band horn antenna with a 76.5-90 GHz frequency range front-end. Simulations with the ray-tracing SPECE code have shown a measurement feasibility of the runaway electrons with energies up to 1 MeV. Due to a low optical depth of the plasma in COMPASS during RE discharges, reflected waves from the tokamak wall can be detected as well. First results show strong connection with other RE diagnostics at COMPASS. The V-ECE can obtain important information about RE population evolution and primary generation mechanism.},

   abstract = {Recent measurements of microwave and x-ray emission during edge localized mode (ELM) activity in tokamak plasmas provide a fresh perspective on ELM physics. It is evident that electron kinetics, which are not incorporated in standard (fluid) models for the instability that drives ELMs, play a key role in the new observations. These effects should be included in future models for ELMs and the ELM cycle. The observed radiative effects paradoxically imply acceleration of electrons parallel to the magnetic field combined with rapid acquisition of perpendicular momentum. It is shown that this paradox can be resolved by the action of the anomalous Doppler instability which enables fast collective radiative relaxation, in the perpendicular direction, of electrons accelerated in the parallel direction by inductive electric fields generated by the initial ELM instability.},

   abstract = {Magnetosonic-whistler waves may be destabilized by runaway electrons both in fusion and astrophysical plasmas. A linear instability growth rate of these waves in the presence of a runaway avalanche is calculated both perturbatively and by numerical solution of the full dispersion equation. The local threshold of the instability depends on the fraction of runaways, the magnetic field, and the temperature of the background plasma. The quasilinear analysis shows that the main result of the instability is the scattering of the electrons in pitch-angle. It appears possible that this instability could explain why the number of runaway electrons generated in tokamak disruptions depends on the strength of the magnetic field.

   abstract = {Avoidance of the harmful effects of runaway electrons (REs) in plasma-terminating disruptions is pivotal in the design of safety systems for magnetic fusion devices. Here, we describe a computationally efficient numerical tool, that allows for self-consistent simulations of plasma cooling and associated RE dynamics during disruptions. It solves flux-surface averaged transport equations for the plasma density, temperature and poloidal flux, using a bounce-averaged kinetic equation to self-consistently provide the electron current, heat, density and RE evolution, as well as the electron distribution function. As an example, we consider disruption scenarios with material injection and compare the electron dynamics resolved with different levels of complexity, from fully kinetic to fluid modes.

Nature of problem: Self-consistently simulates the plasma evolution in a tokamak disruption, with specific emphasis on runaway electron dynamics. The runaway electrons can be simulated either as a fluid, fully kinetically, or as a mix of the two. Plasma temperature, current density, electric field, ion density and charge states are all evolved self-consistently, where kinetic non-thermal contributions are captured using an orbit-averaged relativistic electron Fokker-Planck equation, which couples to the plasma evolution. In the typical use case, the electrons are represented by two distinct populations: a cold fluid population and a kinetic superthermal population.
Solution method: The system of equations is solved using a standard multidimensional Newton's method. Partial differential equations-most prominently the bounce-averaged Fokker-Planck and current diffusion equations-are discretized using a high-resolution finite volume scheme that preserves density and positivity.

Finite gyroradius effects in both field-particle and test-particle terms are evaluated. When implemented in gyrokinetic simulations, these effects can be precomputed. The field-particle operator at each time step requires the evaluation of a single two-dimensional integral, and is not only more accurate, but appears to be less expensive to evaluate than conserving model operators.},

   abstract = {Density sweeping-down experiments have been performed in order to investigate the electron dynamics and the effects on instabilities such as magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) in the low collisionality regime in the Experimental Advanced Superconducting Tokamak (EAST). It is found that an electrostatic instability is always excited which is recognized as the anomalous Doppler instability (ADI). The ADI is characterized by the stair-stepping electron cyclotron emission (ECE), converting the parallel energy to the perpendicular component of energetic electrons in the direction of the magnetic field. The background electron temperature profile is redistributed which results in the gradient change in the core. Non-negligible bootstrap current causes the loop voltage decrease. The bootstrap current is dissipated by the bursting MHD instability which is explained as the Alfven-acoustic mode. Analysis indicates that bulk electrons are easily trapped in the steepened temperature gradient region, intensifying the asymmetry of electron velocity distribution in the parallel direction and creating the bootstrap current in the low-collisionality regime. In particular, it is shown that the global Alfven-acoustic mode dramatically removes trapped electrons and quenches the bootstrap current, which is the main limit for the bootstrap current life.},

   abstract = {The effects of kinetic whistler wave instabilities on the runaway-electron (RE) avalanche is investigated. With parameters from experiments at the DIII-D National Fusion Facility, we show that RE scattering from excited whistler waves can explain several poorly understood experimental results. We find an enhancement of the RE avalanche for low density and high electric field, but for high density and low electric field the scattering can suppress the avalanche and raise the threshold electric field, bringing the present model much closer to observations. The excitation of kinetic instabilities and the scattering of resonant electrons are calculated self-consistently using a quasilinear model and local approximation. We also explain the observed fast growth of electron cyclotron emission signals and excitation of very low-frequency whistler modes observed in the quiescent RE experiments at DIII-D tokamak. Simulations using ITER parameters show that by controlling the background thermal plasma density and temperature, the plasma waves can also be excited spontaneously in tokamak disruptions and the avalanche generation of runaway electrons may be suppressed.},

   abstract = {A self-consistent analysis of the relevant physics regarding the formation and termination of runaway beams during mitigated disruptions by Ar and Ne injection is presented for selected ITER scenarios with the aim of improving our understanding of the physics underlying the runaway heat loads onto the plasma facing components (PFCs) and identifying open issues for developing and accessing disruption mitigation schemes for ITER. This is carried out by means of simplified models, but still retaining sufficient details of the key physical processes, including: (a) the expected dominant runaway generation mechanisms (avalanche and primary runaway seeds: Dreicer and hot tail runaway generation, tritium decay and Compton scattering of. rays emitted by the activated wall), (b) effects associated with the plasma and runaway current density profile shape, and (c) corrections to the runaway dynamics to account for the collisions of the runaways with the partially stripped impurity ions, which are found to have strong effects leading to low runaway current generation and low energy conversion during current termination for mitigated disruptions by noble gas injection (particularly for Ne injection) for the shortest current quench times compatible with acceptable forces on the ITER vessel and in-vessel components (tau(res) similar to 22 ms). For the case of long current quench times (tau(res) similar to 66 ms), runaway beams up to similar to 10 MA can be generated during the disruption current quench and, if the termination of the runaway current is slow enough, the generation of runaways by the avalanche mechanism can play an important role, increasing substantially the energy deposited by the runaways onto the PFCs up to a few hundreds of MJs. Mixed impurity (Ar or Ne) plus deuterium injection proves to be effective in controlling the formation of the runaway current during the current quench, even for the longest current quench times, as well as in decreasing the energy deposited on the runaway electrons during current termination.},

   abstract = {Tokamak start-up on present-day devices usually relies on inductively induced voltage from a central solenoid. In some cases, inductive startup is assisted with auxiliary power from electron cyclotron radio frequency heating. International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor, the National Spherical Torus Experiment Upgrade and JT60, now under construction, will make use of the understanding gained from present-day devices to ensure successful start-up. Design of a spherical tokamak (ST) with DT capability for nuclear component testing would require an alternative to a central solenoid because the small central column in an ST has insufficient space to provide shielding for the insulators in the solenoid. Alternative start-up techniques such as induction using outer poloidal field coils, electron Bernstein wave start-up, coaxial helicity injection, and point source helicity injection have been used with success, but require demonstration of scaling to higher plasma current.

The full particle version of these models, in which both the electrons and ions are treated as particles, makes no approximations to the basic laws of mechanics and electricity and magnetism, and thus the full range of collisionless plasma physics is included in such a model. The basic techniques involved in a PIC model are illustrated: accumulation of the charge and current densities on a spatial grid, time integration of the field and particle equations, and limitations imposed by the underlying kinetic physics of a plasma. Various approximations to the full set of Maxwell's equations are described as well as the case of hybrid models (particle ions, fluid electrons) in which fluid equations are used to model the slow time evolution of high frequency phenomena, thus allowing a study of lower frequency kinetic phenomena on longer temporal and larger spatial scales. Examples of PIC simulations of magnetic reconnection are discussed.},

   abstract = {Improved understanding of runaway-electron formation and decay processes are of prime interest for the safe operation of large tokamaks, and the dynamics of the runaway electrons during dynamical scenarios such as disruptions are of particular concern. In this paper, we present kinetic modelling of scenarios with time-dependent plasma parameters; in particular, we investigate hot-tail runaway generation during a rapid drop in plasma temperature. With the goal of studying runaway-electron generation with a self-consistent electric-field evolution, we also discuss the implementation of a collision operator that conserves momentum and energy and demonstrate its properties. An operator for avalanche runaway-electron generation, which takes the energy dependence of the scattering cross section and the runaway distribution into account, is investigated. We show that the simplified avalanche model of Rosenbluth and Putvinskii (1997 Nucl. Fusion 37 1355) can give inaccurate results for the avalanche growth rate (either lower or higher) for many parameters, especially when the average runaway energy is modest, such as during the initial phase of the avalanche multiplication. The developments presented pave the way for improved modelling of runaway-electron dynamics during disruptions or other dynamic events.},

We present numerical solutions of the kinetic equation and discuss the implications for the threshold electric field. We show that the effective electric field necessary for significant runaway-electron formation often is higher than previously calculated due to both (1) extremely strong dependence of primary generation on temperature and (2) synchrotron radiation losses. We also address the effective critical field in the context of a transition from runaway growth to decay. We find agreement with recent experiments, but show that the observation of an elevated effective critical field can mainly be attributed to changes in the momentum-space distribution of runaways, and only to a lesser extent to a de facto change in the critical field.},

   abstract = {Investigations of runaway electrons (REs) during induced disruptions are performed at the TEXTOR tokamak. The synchrotron radiation generated by REs in the plasma core is detected using an infrared camera. The measurements enable the observation of the structure and dynamics of the runaway beam. In particular, the runaway beam is investigated as a function of the vertical and horizontal control fields. From the plasma current a runaway number of 4.33 x 10(16) was calculated. The number of REs with energies exceeding 25 MeV is 6.4 x 10(15) according to the synchrotron measurement at the end of the current quench phase. The mean pitch angle of the > 25 MeV runaways is found to be 52 mrad which is smaller than in the low density discharge scenario. In addition, the synchrotron measurements show for the first time that a significant number of the high energy REs can survive after the end of the current plateau phase. In order to understand this, runaway orbit calculations have been performed which are in good agreement with the measurements.},

   abstract = {Ray tracing codes are useful to study the electromagnetic wave propagation and absorption in the geometrical optics approximation. In magnetized fusion plasma community, most ray tracing codes assume the plasma density and temperature be functions of the magnetic flux and study waves only inside the last closed flux surface, which are sufficient for the present day tokamak. However, they are difficult to be used for configurations with open magnetic field line plasmas, such as mirror machine and field-reversed-configuration (FRC). We develop a ray tracing code in cylindrical coordinates (r, phi, z) to support arbitrary axisymmetric configurations with both closed and open field lines plasmas. For wave propagation, the cold plasma dispersion relation is usually sufficient, and we require the magnetic field B(r, z) and species densities n(s0)(r, z) profiles as input. For wave absorption, we require a further temperature T-s0(r, z) profile to solve a hot kinetic plasma dispersion relation. In difference to other ray tracing codes which calculate the imaginary part of wave vector k(andupdatedExpOTTOM;,i) for wave absorption, we calculate the imaginary part of wave frequency omega(i), which is shown to be equivalent with the former technique under weak damping approximation. The code can use either numerical or analytical equilibrium. Examples and benchmarks with electron cyclotron wave, lower hybrid wave and ion cyclotron wave for tokamak, spherical tokamak (ST), FRC and mirror machine are shown.

However, conventional algorithms are not applicable to this problem due to the coherent accumulation of numerical errors. To overcome this difficulty, we develop a volume-preserving algorithm (VPA) with long-term accuracy and conservativeness via a systematic splitting method. Applied to the simulation of runaway electrons with a time-span over 10 magnitudes, the VPA generates accurate results and enables the discovery of new physics for secular runaway dynamics.

   abstract = {A detailed analysis of the synchrotron radiation intensity and energy of runaway electrons is presented for the Experimental Advanced Superconducting Tokamak (EAST). In order to make the energy of the calculated runaway electrons more accurate, we take the Shafranov shift into account. The results of the analysis show that the synchrotron radiation intensity and energy of runaway electrons did not reach the maximum at the same time. The energy of the runaway electrons reached the maximum first, and then the synchrotron radiation intensity of the runaway electrons reached the maximum. We also analyze the runaway electrons density, and find that the density of runaway electrons continuously increased. For this reason, although the energy of the runaway electrons dropped but the synchrotron radiation intensity of the runaway electrons would continue rising for a while.},

The suprathermal electrons driven by LHWs make the interpretation of electron cyclotron emission (ECE) spectrum complex. This paper presents the preliminary results of a synthetic diagnostic for interpreting the ECE measurement results in both ohmic and LHW-heated plasmas on EAST. The synthetic diagnostic is realized by using the simulation code SPECE. The agreement between the simulations and experimental results is fairly good for the ohmic cases. For the LHW case, the simulations don't agree well enough with the measurements.},
