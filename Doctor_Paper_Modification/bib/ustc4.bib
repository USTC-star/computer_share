   abstract = {This paper revisits a number of key aspects of plasma initiation, aiming to clarify concepts, provide definitions and improve understanding, in view of ITER First Plasma operation. It shows that size matters and that breakdown and plasma initiation differ in larger devices. The large thick and conductive ITER vessel slows down the prefill process, the development of the toroidal electric field and affects the dynamics of the poloidal magnetic field at breakdown. The large vacuum vessel requires more than 1 s for the prefill gas to spread over the vessel. It slows down the development of the toroidal electric field, applied to ionize the prefill gas, by about 1 s and complicates the control of the magnetic configuration required for plasma initiation. It is shown that the avalanche process that provides the initial ionization slows down towards the end, if the cross-section of the toroidal discharge is larger. On the other hand, a larger plasma volume is beneficial for the subsequent burn-through of main-species ionization and impurity line-radiation. ITER First Plasma operation aims to reach a minimum plasma current of 100 kA, which will require a full avalanche and a partial burn-through to reach electron temperatures of at least 10-20 eV. The burn-through limits the ITER prefill pressure upper range of about 1 mPa. These predictions are based on OD models of plasma initiation that furthermore assume the plasma volume remains constant. As burn-through is a critical process, models that consider radial profiles and/or volume dynamics, could provide further insight in the constraints of ITER plasma initiation. Electron cyclotron heating (ECH) high-power microwaves can be used to assist the ITER plasma initiation process. Although the ECH burn-through assist is reasonably well understood, no model exist that can predict the behaviour of ECH pre-ionization on ITER plasma initiation. ECH burn-through assist is shown to be ineffective for ITER First Plasma operations. Low prefill pressures are thought to increase the likelihood to develop a highly energetic supra-thermal electron discharge during the plasma initiation process. Considering supra-thermal electrons could affect the assumptions for the plasma resistance or even the ionization rate coefficient in plasma initiation models, hence altering the expected dynamics. Furthermore, only a qualitative picture of the processes that cause such supra-thermal discharges exists and a dedicated model is needed to improve ITER predictions.},

   abstract = {Relativistic electrons emit synchrotron radiation due to their gyro- and guiding-center motions in a curved magnetic field. In this article, the kinetic theory of relativistic electron beams is developed to account for radiation reaction by including the Abraham-Lorentz reaction force in the kinetic equation. As an application of this theory, the dynamics of runaway electrons is examined and a steady-state solution is constructed describing a balance between acceleration by the electric field, pitch-angle scattering, and radiation reaction. Furthermore, it is found that a beam of relativistic electrons can be slowed down by the combined effects of pitch-angle scattering and radiation reaction. This damping can be more efficient than ordinary collisional drag, and appears to explain the decay of post-disruption runaway currents in the Joint European Torus (JET) [R. D. Gill, Nucl. Fusion 33, 1613 (1993)]. (C) 2001 American Institute of Physics.},

Applications such as the luminosity of a collider, the use as kinematic variable, and the statistical theory of collisions in a relativistic classical gas are reviewed.

   abstract = {Large-angle Coulomb collisions lead to an avalanching generation of runaway electrons in a plasma. We present the first fully conservative large-angle collision operator, derived from the relativistic Boltzmann operator. The relation to previous models for large-angle collisions is investigated, and their validity assessed. We present a form of the generalized collision operator which is suitable for implementation in a numerical kinetic equation solver, and demonstrate the effect on the runaway-electron growth rate. Finally we consider the reverse avalanche effect, where runaways are slowed down by large-angle collisions, and show that the choice of operator is important if the electric field is close to the avalanche threshold.},

   abstract = {Due to an increased interest in runaway electron (RE) phenomena in tokamak research, the need for diagnostics of runaway electron population in plasma has emerged. A novel diagnostic of the nonthermal electron cyclotron emission from runaway electrons can be utilized for this purpose. It was designed and installed at the COMPASS tokamak based on the available heterodyne radiometer. The vertical ECE (V-ECE) system uses a 16-channel heterodyne radiometer with a vertically placed E2-band horn antenna with a 76.5-90 GHz frequency range front-end. Simulations with the ray-tracing SPECE code have shown a measurement feasibility of the runaway electrons with energies up to 1 MeV. Due to a low optical depth of the plasma in COMPASS during RE discharges, reflected waves from the tokamak wall can be detected as well. First results show strong connection with other RE diagnostics at COMPASS. The V-ECE can obtain important information about RE population evolution and primary generation mechanism.},

This is carried out by means of simplified models, but still retaining sufficient details of the key physical processes, including: (a) the expected dominant runaway generation mechanisms (avalanche and primary runaway seeds: Dreicer and hot tail runaway generation, tritium decay and Compton scattering of. rays emitted by the activated wall), (b) effects associated with the plasma and runaway current density profile shape, and (c) corrections to the runaway dynamics to account for the collisions of the runaways with the partially stripped impurity ions, which are found to have strong effects leading to low runaway current generation and low energy conversion during current termination for mitigated disruptions by noble gas injection (particularly for Ne injection) for the shortest current quench times compatible with acceptable forces on the ITER vessel and in-vessel components (tau(res) similar to 22 ms). For the case of long current quench times (tau(res) similar to 66 ms), runaway beams up to similar to 10 MA can be generated during the disruption current quench and, if the termination of the runaway current is slow enough, the generation of runaways by the avalanche mechanism can play an important role, increasing substantially the energy deposited by the runaways onto the PFCs up to a few hundreds of MJs. Mixed impurity (Ar or Ne) plus deuterium injection proves to be effective in controlling the formation of the runaway current during the current quench, even for the longest current quench times, as well as in decreasing the energy deposited on the runaway electrons during current termination.},

The full particle version of these models, in which both the electrons and ions are treated as particles, makes no approximations to the basic laws of mechanics and electricity and magnetism, and thus the full range of collisionless plasma physics is included in such a model. The basic techniques involved in a PIC model are illustrated: accumulation of the charge and current densities on a spatial grid, time integration of the field and particle equations, and limitations imposed by the underlying kinetic physics of a plasma. Various approximations to the full set of Maxwell's equations are described as well as the case of hybrid models (particle ions, fluid electrons) in which fluid equations are used to model the slow time evolution of high frequency phenomena, thus allowing a study of lower frequency kinetic phenomena on longer temporal and larger spatial scales. Examples of PIC simulations of magnetic reconnection are discussed.},

We present numerical solutions of the kinetic equation and discuss the implications for the threshold electric field. We show that the effective electric field necessary for significant runaway-electron formation often is higher than previously calculated due to both (1) extremely strong dependence of primary generation on temperature and (2) synchrotron radiation losses. We also address the effective critical field in the context of a transition from runaway growth to decay. We find agreement with recent experiments, but show that the observation of an elevated effective critical field can mainly be attributed to changes in the momentum-space distribution of runaways, and only to a lesser extent to a de facto change in the critical field.},

   abstract = {Investigations of runaway electrons (REs) during induced disruptions are performed at the TEXTOR tokamak. The synchrotron radiation generated by REs in the plasma core is detected using an infrared camera. The measurements enable the observation of the structure and dynamics of the runaway beam. In particular, the runaway beam is investigated as a function of the vertical and horizontal control fields. From the plasma current a runaway number of 4.33 x 10(16) was calculated. The number of REs with energies exceeding 25 MeV is 6.4 x 10(15) according to the synchrotron measurement at the end of the current quench phase. The mean pitch angle of the > 25 MeV runaways is found to be 52 mrad which is smaller than in the low density discharge scenario. In addition, the synchrotron measurements show for the first time that a significant number of the high energy REs can survive after the end of the current plateau phase. In order to understand this, runaway orbit calculations have been performed which are in good agreement with the measurements.},

   abstract = {Ray tracing codes are useful to study the electromagnetic wave propagation and absorption in the geometrical optics approximation. In magnetized fusion plasma community, most ray tracing codes assume the plasma density and temperature be functions of the magnetic flux and study waves only inside the last closed flux surface, which are sufficient for the present day tokamak. However, they are difficult to be used for configurations with open magnetic field line plasmas, such as mirror machine and field-reversed-configuration (FRC). We develop a ray tracing code in cylindrical coordinates (r, phi, z) to support arbitrary axisymmetric configurations with both closed and open field lines plasmas. For wave propagation, the cold plasma dispersion relation is usually sufficient, and we require the magnetic field B(r, z) and species densities n(s0)(r, z) profiles as input. For wave absorption, we require a further temperature T-s0(r, z) profile to solve a hot kinetic plasma dispersion relation. In difference to other ray tracing codes which calculate the imaginary part of wave vector k(andupdatedExpOTTOM;,i) for wave absorption, we calculate the imaginary part of wave frequency omega(i), which is shown to be equivalent with the former technique under weak damping approximation. The code can use either numerical or analytical equilibrium. Examples and benchmarks with electron cyclotron wave, lower hybrid wave and ion cyclotron wave for tokamak, spherical tokamak (ST), FRC and mirror machine are shown.

However, conventional algorithms are not applicable to this problem due to the coherent accumulation of numerical errors. To overcome this difficulty, we develop a volume-preserving algorithm (VPA) with long-term accuracy and conservativeness via a systematic splitting method. Applied to the simulation of runaway electrons with a time-span over 10 magnitudes, the VPA generates accurate results and enables the discovery of new physics for secular runaway dynamics.

   abstract = {A detailed analysis of the synchrotron radiation intensity and energy of runaway electrons is presented for the Experimental Advanced Superconducting Tokamak (EAST). In order to make the energy of the calculated runaway electrons more accurate, we take the Shafranov shift into account. The results of the analysis show that the synchrotron radiation intensity and energy of runaway electrons did not reach the maximum at the same time. The energy of the runaway electrons reached the maximum first, and then the synchrotron radiation intensity of the runaway electrons reached the maximum. We also analyze the runaway electrons density, and find that the density of runaway electrons continuously increased. For this reason, although the energy of the runaway electrons dropped but the synchrotron radiation intensity of the runaway electrons would continue rising for a while.},

   abstract = {The current-drive technique, using lower hybrid waves (LHWs) for radio-frequency heating, is of highest priority on EAST, and over 100 s steady-state long-pulse H-mode plasmas have been achieved recently. The suprathermal electrons driven by LHWs make the interpretation of electron cyclotron emission (ECE) spectrum complex. This paper presents the preliminary results of a synthetic diagnostic for interpreting the ECE measurement results in both ohmic and LHW-heated plasmas on EAST. The synthetic diagnostic is realized by using the simulation code SPECE. The agreement between the simulations and experimental results is fairly good for the ohmic cases. For the LHW case, the simulations don't agree well enough with the measurements.},
