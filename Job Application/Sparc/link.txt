Interpreting experimental diagnostics data in tokamaks, while considering non-ideal effects, is
challenging due to the complexity of plasmas. To address this challenge, a general synthetic
diagnostics (GSD) platform has been established that facilitates microwave imaging
reflectometry and electron cyclotron emission imaging. This platform utilizes plasma profiles as
input and incorporates the finite-difference time domain, ray tracing and the radiative transfer
equation to calculate the propagation of plasma spontaneous radiation and the external
electromagnetic field in plasmas. Benchmark tests for classical cases have been conducted to
verify the accuracy of every core module in the GSD platform. Finally, 2D imaging of a typical
electron temperature distribution is reproduced by this platform and the results are consistent
with the given real experimental data. This platform also has the potential to be extended to 3D
electromagnetic field simulations and other microwave diagnostics such as cross-polarization
scattering.
